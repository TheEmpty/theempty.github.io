I just wanted to briefly mention why `empty.rocks` exists for anyone
coming here from some of my Java packages or just creepy stalking.
There were a few reasons to grabbing this domain, one was finally having
"empty" on a TLD. Another was having a domain that was a qualified package
name, my previous main domain had a hyphen.
