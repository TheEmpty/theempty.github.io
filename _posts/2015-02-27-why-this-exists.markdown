## Why I Rock
I just wanted to briefly mention why `empty.rocks` exists for anyone
coming here from some of my Java packages or just creepy stalking.
There were a few reasons to grabbing this domain, one was finally having
"empty" on a TLD. Another was having a domain that was a qualified package
name, my previous main domain had a hyphen.

## When I Rock
The site will most likely start being update with projects September.
That's after I graduate and move.

## What I Will Rock
I have two main projects in mind.

* A 1/10th scale RC car using a Raspberry Pi 2 to guide itself on race tracks.
* Either a MK4 or GTM from [Factory Five Racing](factoryfive.com), which one depends on how much blood, sweat, and tears I'm willing to put into the project. A V8 Cobra is plenty powerful for track days, but a GTM, even if it was a 4 cylinder is unique and stylish. But I doubt to start a kit before 2016.
